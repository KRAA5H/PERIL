# 1. Critical Infrastructure and Facilities

**What to collect:**

- Geolocations of government buildings, transport hubs (stations, airports), religious sites, financial centers, event venues, hospitals, and schools.
- Crowd-drawing locations (stadiums, shopping centers, tourist sites).

**Sources:**

- OpenStreetMap for building footprints and points of interest (POI)
- London city data portals and UK government datasets (e.g., gov.uk open data)
- Data from the National Risk Register for critical infrastructure categories

**Meaning:**

These sites are high-value targets due to symbolic, economic, or logistical significance. Presence in these categories increases a building’s threat profile.

# 2. Historical Incident and Attack Data

**What to collect:**

- Past terror attack locations and details (type, date, target, casualty)
- Other relevant crime data (bomb threats, hate crimes, violent incidents)

**Sources:**

- Global Terrorism Database (open, comprehensive worldwide records)
- TerrorismTracker/Global Terrorism Index for up-to-date and localized events
- Metropolitan Police or ONS local crime statistics

**Meaning:**

Recurring or recent attacks in an area indicate a pattern or specific vulnerability, escalating its risk level.

# 3. Environmental and Population Data

**What to collect:**

- Population density and foot traffic estimations
- Proximity to transportation routes, borders, or high-density events

**Sources:**

- UK census data (ONS), London city council data for population figures
- OpenStreetMap and local travel agencies for transport routes

**Meaning:**

Densely populated buildings or areas, or those close to main transit corridors, present greater opportunity and impact for attackers, elevating their risk.

# 4. Facility Vulnerability Attributes

**What to collect:**

- Accessibility (publicly open, security screening present or absent)
- Structural vulnerabilities (e.g., multiple entrances, lack of barriers, open spaces)
- Whether building hosts regular large gatherings

**Sources:**

- Public facility blueprints (occasionally published for older/larger sites)
- Surveys or open government facility descriptions
- City risk registers and preparedness reports

**Meaning:**

Easily accessible or poorly secured buildings are inherently more vulnerable to attack, increasing threat level.

# 5. Official Designation and Alerts

**What to collect:**

- Buildings/areas officially designated “soft targets” by counter-terror authorities
- Recent alerts or elevated threat levels from law enforcement

**Sources:**

- UK Counter Terrorism Protective Security Advice and public advisories
- Reports or alert bulletins via local authorities or CTPN reports

**Meaning:**

Official risk designations and alerts signal prioritized concern and usually reflect a credible, recent assessment of specific threat.
